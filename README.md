## CLI

After installation the `supplies` command will be available in your terminal. The CLI is available under `node ./bin/supplies.js` when developing.

### Get

#### Get the supply of a native coin

```shell
supplies get <driver name>
```

#### Get supply of a specific coin or a token

```shell
supplies get <driver name> -r <smart contract address>
```

#### Flags


| Name      | Flag                    | Description
| ----------| ------------------------| ---
| Decimals  | `-d`, `--decimals`      | Some drivers like Etherscan require decimals.
| Reference | `-r`, `--reference`     | Reference is a unique id for a specific driver; for example a smart contract address.
| Modifiers | `-m`, `--modifiers`     | Wallets addresses to subtract from the total supply; for example wallets hold by the foundation or burn addresses. Split the addresses with a comma and without spaces.
| Record    | `-R`, `--record`        | Record the requests and coin, and save them as fixtures. This is for developing purposes.
| API Key   | `-k`, `--key`           | For passing down an API key when the driver requires one. When used in combination with the `-r` flag the key will be masked in the fixtures.
| No cache  | `--nocache`             | Skip using the cache.
